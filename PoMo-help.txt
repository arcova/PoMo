            hyphy_bin file

PoMo10 script version 1.0.2

positional arguments:
  hyphy_bin             Absolute path of the HYPHY binary used to maximize the
                        likelihood.
  file                  Name of the fasta file containing the alignment. Each
                        individual's name must be species_n where "species" is
                        the name of its species, without underscores, and "n"
                        is a number identifying the individual among the other
                        samples of the same population/species (it actually
                        does not matter which number is given to which
                        individual). As now, no gaps or Ns are allowed, which
                        means, you have to remove columns where one of the
                        individuals has missing characters or unknowns. It
                        does not matter from which individual each base comes,
                        so you can sub-sample and randomly assign to
                        individuals within a species.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m {0,1}, --molecular-clock {0,1}
                        Determines if you want the molecular clock constraint
                        (and therefore also look for a root) or not. Default
                        is yes. Type `-m 0` to specify no molecular clock.
  -u MM, --MM MM        Allows to choose a mutation model different from the
                        HKY (default option). `GTR` corresponds to the general
                        time reversible, `F81` to the Felsenstein 1981
                        (reversible, equal mutation rates), and `NONREV` to
                        the general nonreversible model (all substitution
                        rates are independent). To change, type for example
                        `--MM GTR`.
  -s SM, --SM SM        Allows to choose fixation rates. `-s NoSel`: fixation
                        rates are equal for all nucleotides; default. `-s
                        GCvsAT`: one parameter describes fixation difference
                        of GC versus AT, as is expected from biased gene
                        conversion. `-s AllNuc`: each nucleotide has a
                        different fitness (3 free parameters since only
                        fitness differences matter). Warning: estimating
                        fixation biases will be more time consuming.
  -g GM, --GM GM        Allows to set a variable mutation rate over sites,
                        gamma-distributed, approximated with a number of
                        classes as specified by the user. Default: uniform
                        mutation rate. For example, `--GM 6` specifies a gamma
                        distribution of total mutation rate with 6 discrete
                        cathegories.
  -f GS, --GS GS        Allows to set a variable fixation bias over sites,
                        gamma-distributed, approximated with a number of
                        classes as specified by the user. Default: uniform
                        fixation rate (`f 0`).
  -d DS_RATIO, --ds-ratio DS_RATIO
                        Determines which proportion of the data is kept after
                        downsampling. Downsampling is done when sites do not
                        have the same coverage along the genome. In such a
                        case, all sites with coverage higher than a certain
                        sample size are downsampled, those with lower coverage
                        are discarded. The threshold sample size is chosen as
                        the highest possible that leaves the kept number of
                        sites above the specified threshold. By default,
                        sample sizes are decreased until at least 2 thirds of
                        the sites are included (`-d 0.66`).
  -v, --verbose         turn on verbosity
  --version             show program's version number and exit
